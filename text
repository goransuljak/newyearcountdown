// NEW YEAR COUNTDOWN //
(after we styled our landing page we need to make it come alive)

1. WE NEED DAYS HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDES
(we create event variables const)
2. WE NEED TO GENERATE THE ACTUAL YEAR
(example so we dont have to update it each year would be
const current = new Date().getFullYear();
const newyeartime = new Date(`January 01 ${current + 1} 00:00:00`); )
3. THEN WE CREATE FUNCTION UPDATECOUNTDOWN
(we set current time, and then we need to set difference between new year time
and the current time, we do that simply by const difference = newyeartime - currentime;)

4. THEN WE CALCULATE DAYS HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS
(for days lets say Math.floor(difference/ 1000);
(for minutes lets say Math.floor(difference/ 1000 / 60) % 60; // to get remaing time %
(for hours lets say Math.floor(difference/ 1000 / 60 / 60) % 24; // to get remaining time
(for days lets say Math.floor(difference/ 1000) % 60; // to get remaing secondes

5. TO RUN IT EVERY SECOND WE USE SETINTERVAL
(setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000);

6. WE SET DAYS HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS TO INNERHTML
(for minutes we want minutes.innerHTML = m < 10 ? '0' + m : m);
